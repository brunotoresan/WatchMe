## ðŸ”¥ About the project
This a app that mocks an API with Axios to list and organize movies based on their genres. This was a refactor challenge where I moved the Content and the Side Bar to their own React Components. The main lesson learned was that sometimes we have data that needs to be shared between two components, therefore we should place that data in a parent component (when I did this challenge I had not learned React context yet)


## ðŸ’» Installation and execution
To install: `yarn install`<br>
To run: `yarn dev` and `yarn server`
